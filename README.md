# AWS-SageMaker-for-building-and-training-a-simple-neural-network-with-synthetic-data.
We will create a simple neural network example in an AWS SageMaker notebook. We'll use a synthetic dataset to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on two features:  Website visit duration Number of pages visited. This is a binary classification problem, and we'll use a small neural network for quick execution.
